                    <h1> OUR STORY</h1><br>
                    <p> Med school sucked. Information was needlessly overworked and extraneous, materials<br> were expensive, and the sources were disjoined and scattered. We got the job done <br>and did well, but knew there had to be a better way. We had the knowledge, skill and <br>scores to do it. So we went to work; we got a white board, a camera, and started <br>making videos. It worked. People used it. People LIKED it. Our interest is in making<br> better doctors, which is why our videos are and always will be free. But we wanted to<br> reach more people and be more than just a cool video site only a handful of people <br>knew about. We wanted to change medical education. To do that, we needed<br> resources. So we created a boatload of additional content in our signature style and<br> started a business. Every week the site and the content continues to grow. We hope <br>you enjoy our work. Good or bad, let us know by contacting us.</p><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;

                    <p>Dustyn is a board-certified Internal Medicine physician. He did his undergrad at Yale,<br> toured the streets of New Haven as a paramedic, then went to Tulane for medical<br> school. It was there he met his mentors that coached him towards education. He's<br> a Hospitalist at Baton Rouge General where he's the Clerkship Director for Tulane<br> students in the LEAD curriculum and Core Faculty for the Baton Rouge General <br>Internal Medicine Residency Program. From teaching technique to curricula, he's <br>always looking for cutting edge research and data to support it. When not in the<br> hospital or in front of the classroom, he's creating new content and trying to convince <br>Jamie to put his beloved cat on everything OnlineMedEd. </p>
